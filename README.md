# Midi-Router(Usb Midi Host) 
This is a work in progress and will likely need some improvements but is mostly functional.
This is a Linux based Midi Router(Usb Midi Host) With Webgui for manual connections.
You can also connect device automatically if you want to use the router as a standalone device.
Disclaimer...I am not a coder so I had to get Ai help to turn my idea into usable code. 
I have included the Html code for the Webgui seperately incase anyone needs it.
The full code is also included, feel free to download it and improve it.
I built my version of this usb midi host with an old Android TV Box with Armbian installed.
I will include a some extra files like example files and a Install guide that may or may not be complete.
Like I said this is a work in progress and kind of a spontanious thing so not everything was well documented.
